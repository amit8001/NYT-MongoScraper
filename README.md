# NYT-MongoScraper

I developed this scraping application using below stated technologies  
- Handlebars.js
- Express.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- cheerio
- axios/request

</br>
This application allows a user to scrape latest articles from "https://www.nytimes.com/section/us" webpage. </br>
User can initiate scraping by cliking the "initiate Scraping" button. User can then choose to save the article by clicking the "Save Article" button.
The saved articles can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button.
One can also add and delete notes for the saved articles. 

I deployed this app to Heroku as well. The link is https://nytimesscraper-ap.herokuapp.com/.
