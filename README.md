# NYT-MongoScraper

I developed this scraping application using below stated technologies  
- Handlebars.js
- Express.js
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- cheerio
- axios/request

This application allows a user to scrape latest articles from "https://www.nytimes.com/section/us" webpage. </br>
- User can initiate scraping by clicking the "Initiate Scraping" button.</br>
- User can then choose to save the article by clicking the "Save Article" button.</br>
- The saved articles can be deleted by clicking the "Delete" button.</br>
- One can also add and delete notes for the saved articles.</br>

I deployed this app to Heroku as well. The link is https://nytimesscraper-ap.herokuapp.com/.
